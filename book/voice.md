# 八种被动语态

**一、语态**  
语态是动词的一种形式，用以说明主语与谓语动词之间的关系。英语有主动语态、被动语态。
* 主动语态表示主语是动作的执行者；
* 被动语态表示主语是动作的承受者；
  * 被动语态是动词的一种特殊形式；
  * 一般说来，只有需要动作对象的及物动词才有被动语态。
* 前面的时态示例为主动语态。

**二、被动语态的说明**  
主动语态变被动语态时，主动语态句中的宾语变成被动语态句中的主语，主动语态句中的主语成为被动语态句中的动作的执行者。

1. 因为是宾语改作为主语，所以表明谓语动词为及物动词。
2. 可作被动语态的时态有下面八种，也是说初中所学时态均有被动语态。
3. 被动语态与主动语态的区别是，主动语态的及物动词（也是谓语最后一个动词），改为be+过去分词。
4. 公式为：时态前面部分 + 动词的态 -> 时态前面部分 + be的态 + 动词的过去分词。
5. 过去分词与过去式变态形式完全相同，非主动态谓语动词时，一般称为过去分词。

以ask（问）为例:

| 时态 | 主动 | 被动 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `一般`现在时 * | `asks/ask` | `am/is/are` asked |
|  | am/is/are  | 无 |
| `一般`过去时 * | `asked` | `was/were` asked |
| `一般`将来时 * | shall/will `ask` | shall/will `be` asked |
|  |  am/is/are going to `ask` | am/is/are going to `be` asked |
| `一般`过去将来时 * | should/would `ask` | should/would `be` ask |
|  |  was/were going to `ask` | was/were going to `be` ask |
| 现在`进行`时 * | am/is/are `asking` | am/is/are `being` asked |
| 过去`进行`时 * | was/were asking | was/were `being` asked |
| 现在`完成`时 * | have/has `asked` | have/has `been` asked  |
| 过去`完成`时 * | had `asked` | had `been` asked  |
| 情态动词 | can ask | can be  asked  |
